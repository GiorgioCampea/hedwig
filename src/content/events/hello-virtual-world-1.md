As our lives move more and more into the virtual world, let's explore how we can use our coding skills and knowledge in JavaScript and HTML to create a virtual world of our own.
In this session, through a live demo, we will cover the basics of creating a simple virtual reality game using A-Frame, JavaScript, and the DOM API.
I hope this talk will ignite your creativity and inspire you to create games and have fun!
