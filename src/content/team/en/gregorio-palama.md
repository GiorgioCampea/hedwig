I have been working in the IT industry for over 15 years and I have experience in various sectors. Currently, I hold the role of Devops and Senior Cloud Engineer at Lutech. I am constantly looking for new things to study and learn and I can't stay even one day without updating. I am co-organizer of the GDG Pescara together with other developers, I love to share my knowledge and try to do it in a fun way.
